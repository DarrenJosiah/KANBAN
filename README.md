On laptop (large and medium devices), Drag and Drog API is supported by the browser. CRUD is supported by adding item through the button, editing by double-clicking and deleting by pressing ok without a value.

### Limitations
Drag and Drop API is not supported by smartphones (small screens). Only CRUD is available.
