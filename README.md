### Manual (About the app)
On startup, the app will check for the presence of data in the localStorage, and set default values if non is found. Drag and Drog API is supported by the browser. However, DnD is not supported on Touch Screen devices as a limitation, such as smartphones. CRUD is supported by adding item through the button, editing by double-clicking and deleting by pressing ok without a value.

### Limitations
Drag and Drop API is not supported by smartphones (small screens). Only CRUD is available.
